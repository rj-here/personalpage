            Here, you will find all about me. Projects, developed by me independently or in collaboration with others! The aesthetics will default to be minimal, and simple, as that is how I prefer the styling to be. A visual sense which truly feels like me! Not loud, but elegant looking. You'll also get to know about me outside of the world of coding. Feel free to reach out for collaborations.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <p>
    I'm a student at <span style="color: rgb(255, 64, 64);">York University,</span> studying Computer Security, now in my third year. It's been an up & down rollercoaster for the past 2 years. I've got most of my experience in Java, but also some in C/C++ & Python. I also have moderate experience in JavaScript, HTML & CSS, which when paired together, form the websites I create, then deploy with GitHub Pages.
    I'm looking to be more into the field of cybersecurity, but also more software development, as my major is fundamentally a specialization of computer science. I am open to all kinds of roles, across the fields of cybersecurity, software development/engineering, web development, and more.
    The buzzword is AI (Artificial Intelligence), and I'm trying to learn more, use it more but sensibly. I will right away confess that AI has generated certain components (the menu bar, as well as the icons in the Contact Me page, and the typing effect visible to you up at the top) of this page, but the rest has been me, though AI predicts what to write, and that is fine if it knows my style. 
    I still will NOT be ever using it in academic work, or even professional where prohibitied. 
    </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Work</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0);">Indian </span><span style="color: white;">Society </span><span style="color: green;">of Calgary, </span>Graphics and Social Media Summer Intern | May - August 2025</h5>
    <p>
    In this role over the summer, I created and collaborated on a variety of designs. I leveraged my experience & skills in graphic designing, particularly with Canva.
    I created different types of graphics, dependent on the requirements. It varied from product advertisements, to festive designs, and inforgraphics. This brought me exposure to different types & formats of graphics, and I learned some tips & tricks along the way.
    I also relearned some previous habits & tricks which I had forgotten. This job will always remain special to me, as it is my first job!
    </p>
    <h4>Clubs, Leadership & Volunteering</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 121);">ReWire </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 59, 169);">Club,</span> Operations Associate | July 2025 - present</h5>
    <p>
    As Operations Associate of the productivity-focused ReWire Club, I would be overlooking the regular functioning of the club's many aspects. 
    This includes organization of many club assets, such as our files & communications, and handling a part of logistics for our events.
    I've been filling out many of the forms related to ratification, tabling, and more. I also step in for both my department, and the club more broadly, when needed.
    I handled much of the logistics for our first event of the year, which was a (moderately successful) meet & greet event, with regards to the event venue.
    This is a club that I personally believe in a lot, as the concept and core idea (productivity), is something that I look to improve, so helping myself and others is something that would be highly rewarding.
    That is the driving force behind me taking up what is my first proper leadership role, and finally working in a university club.

    <h5>Lassonde School of Engineering at <span style="color: rgb(255, 64, 64);">York University,</span> Program Representative | October 2025</h5>
    <p>
    On Fall Campus Day 2025, I was a student volunteer at Lassonde School of Engineering. I was a Program Representative for my program/major (Computer Security), and more broadly, Computer Science. I've been wanting to do this for my past 2 years, but scheduling conflicts restricted me in doing so. As my coming week was lighter for the most part, I went ahead and put myself up for it.
    I was interacting with prospective students, and their families, answering their questions, concerns, and providing them with information about the program, how it differs to Computer Science, and my experience as a student, sharing anecdotes and resources.
    It was a fulfilling experience, and it felt good to give back to the Lassonde community. I also later helped out with cleaning up as well as just helping out in navigating people around the building for the experiences offered including tours, showcase, refreshments, and the other program tables.
    I surely look forward to (hopefully) volunteer for 2026 as well! Additionally, I happened to grow my network a bit as well, meeting fellow Computer Science & Computer Security students, as well as some of our amazing engineers, whom I connected with. I also met some professors as well.
    And lastly, I got clarity in how to answer the question of how to differentiate between Computer Science and Computer Security, which I had struggled with before.
    </p>
    <h3>Interests, Hobbies, Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
    My interests are in mainstream consumer technology, (particularly smartphones). I've followed Apple the most, but try to keep up with others. Cricket remains my sport of choice where I am a supporter of the <span style="color: blue;">Indian national team,</span> <span style="color: rgb(196, 0, 0);">Royal Challengers Bengaluru [WPL, IPL]</span>, with a deep following since the pandemic began. I casually play badminton as well.
    My entertainment is across areas. In English, it mostly is podcasts, though I've seen some TV shows & films as well. Movies are mostly in Hindi for me, as is the case for music. Sprinkle in some Punjabi songs & films too. Other interests of mine include graphic designing, photography, and reading. I'll not list out all my favourites across categories, as the list would be really long. I will consider putting a typing effect for it, if I can figure it out at a later time.

    <h4>Hackathons</h4>
    <h5>MLH Global Hack Week: Beginners Week | August 2025</h5>
    <p>
    As I missed out on a recent hackathon, I started (and continue to) hunt hackathons to particpate in. This is when I stumbled into MLH's Global Hack Week, which happens every month and for August 2025 was targeted at beginners.
    This was over a span of a few days, and I learned some bascis across Figma, GitHub, and more. I played around in private files, with no project to show. I learned some basics, and intend to work on things as and when time arises.
    </p>
    <h5>MLH Global Hack Week: Open Source Week | October 2025</h5>
    <p>
    As October 2025 rolled around, and I had some time with Reading Week and a lucky extra day off with no lab, I particpated in MLH's Global Hack Week for Open Source.
    This was a nice expereince, where I learned about Agent Mode in GitHub Copilot, and how to use it better. I did also sign up for another event which I unfortunately couldn't get around to due to Diwali preparations and celebrations.
    </p>
    <h5>DevOps GenAI Hackathon Missisauga | 3rd November, 2025</h5>
    <p>
    This was my first proper hackathon, and I particpated in a team of 4. I was paired with some senior and experienced individuals in the tech space, and I learned a lot from them, and realized I still have a whole lot to learn myself.
    In this hackathon, we were to create a DevOps solution with the use of Generative AI tools. We attempted to create something which when given a GitHub repository link, would use agents we developed to analyze the codebase, extract relevant information such as owner, contributors, tech stack, purpose, and more.
    I was tasked to make the API, which as I was not well-versed with, was very much from agentic AI. While we didn't have a fully polished project, and neither did we win any prizes, I look back at this experience as having learned a lot, and being exposed to new concepts, tools, and ways of thinking. I look to upgrade my skillset for the next hackathon I get a chance to attend.

    <h5>MLH Global Hack Week: API Week | November 2025</h5>
    <p>
    After a grilling few days with personal & professional tasks & commitments, I am taking a day or 2 to relax, and do some things I've been wanting to do. I happen to see MLH hosts their next Global Hack Week, this time focused on APIs.
    I took some time to attend the MongoDB 101 workshop, and look forward to utilizing it in the future.
