    <h1>Rishi</h1>
    <!--<h2>I'm a Computer Security Major</h2>-->
    <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
    <p>Here, you will find all about me. Projects, developed by me independently or in collaboration with others! The aesthetics will be minimal, and simple, as that is how I prefer the styling to be.
    A visual sense which truly feels like me! Not loud, but elegant looking. You'll also get to know about me outside of the world of coding. Feel free to reach out for collaborations.
    </p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <p>
    I'm a student at <span style="color: rgb(255, 64, 64);">York University,</span> studying Computer Security, entering my third year this fall. It's been an up & down rollercoaster for the past 2 years. My strongest of languages is Java, though I have a good grasp of basics in C/C++, as well as Python. 
    This also can be said for JavaScript, which paired with CSS & HTML, are what I use for the construction of my websites, deploying them with GitHub. Artificial intelligence has been emerging at a rapid pace during this era, making life easy & difficult simultaneously.
    I am opening up to use it more now, like improving this page, after being impressed and (in a good way) jealous of the portfolios of my friends and classmates. That being said, I still try to mostly code things myself. However, it's undeniable that it does get used by many, including me. It's there to make my life easier, though I will never fully develop a project with AI.
    Thankfully, I mostly am aware what it is doing, so I can explain to others what it does.
    </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Work</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0);">Indian </span><span style="color: white;">Society </span><span style="color: green;">of Calgary, </span>Graphics and Social Media Summer Intern | May 2025 - present</h5>
    <p>
    I'm creating and collaborating on a variety of designs. I leverage my current experience of using Canva, maintaining & improving on habits & skills I've adopted.
    I'm also getting exposure to the corporate world, as well as working with a team (remotely).
    This happens to be my first job, which is going to remain special to me for precisely this reason!
    </p>
    <h4>Clubs, Leadership & Volunteering</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 121);">ReWire </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 59, 169);">Club,</span> Operations Associate | July 2025 - present</h5>
    <p>
    I've started out in the role, with more action to take place closer to and during the 2025-26 acacdemic year, but I will be overlooking the day-to-day functioning of the club.
    This includes, but is not limited to coordinating events & team meetings, as well as ensuring that the Discord server runs smoothly.
    </p>
    <h3>Interests, Hobbies, Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
    I've been intersted in technology, mostly tracking what's going on in the world of mainstream consumer electronics (particularly smartphones), with Apple being the company I actively follow, but also trying to keep track of what is happening with Google, Samsung, Microsoft, and more.
    I enjoy watching cricket though I am not as good a player of the sport, which I have sporadically viewed since 2016, and have been following deeply since late 2020. 
    Teams I support are the <span style="color: blue;">Indian national team,</span> in addition to the <span style="color: rgb(196, 0, 0);">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</span> in the IPL & WPL. 
    My favourite player is Virat Kohli (AI guessed correct!), he is the reason I initially began following the game. The reason I started following the game more deeply, specifically the red-ball format (Test cricket), is a player called Rishabh Pant. 
    There are many other players I like and admire, but the list can get a little long. Badminton is the other sport I play. It is casual, and I think I perform better in that than cricket. 
    I listen to many podcasts, of which I'll share some of my favourites. <span style="color: rgb(3, 0, 17);">“The Edges & Sledges Cricket Podcast”,</span> and <span style="color: rgb(70, 0, 200);">“The Vergecast”</span> have co-hosts communicate thoughts effectively, and also giving many laughs along the way. 
    <span style="color: red;">“Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast”,</span> is also enjoyable for similar reasons. Test matches, are not covered better in my opinion than by <span style="color: rgb(0, 150, 125);">BBC's “Test Match Special”,</span> which also includes <span style="color: rgb(0, 150, 125);">“No Balls”</span> co-hosted by England women players, Alex Hartley & Kate Cross. 
    I still have lots of English content to consume, but some of my favourite content in the language includes <span style="color: rgb(198, 0, 0);">"Stranger Things”</span> (I am definitely pumped up for Season 5),<span style="color: yellow;"> “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”,</span> <span style="color: red;">“The Mentalist”,</span> and others.
    I mostly listen to Hindi music, sprinkled with some Punjabi songs too. Graphic designing is a fun hobby to have, as well as photography. Reading is also something I enjoy, mixing self-help with entertainment as I still remain a loyal reader of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, created by Jeff Kinney.
