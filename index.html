    <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
    <p>Here, you will find all about me. Projects, developed by me independently or in collaboration with others! The aesthetics will be minimal, and simple, as that is how I prefer the styling to be.
    A visual sense which truly feels like me! Not loud, but elegant looking. You'll also get to know about me outside of the world of coding. Feel free to reach out for collaborations.
    </p>
