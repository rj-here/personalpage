            Here, you will find all about me. Projects, developed by me independently or in collaboration with others! The aesthetics will default to be minimal, and simple, as that is how I prefer the styling to be. A visual sense which truly feels like me! Not loud, but elegant looking. You'll also get to know about me outside of the world of coding. Feel free to reach out for collaborations.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Academics</h3>
    <p>
    I'm a student at <span style="color: rgb(255, 64, 64);">York University,</span> studying Computer Security, now in my third year. It's been an up & down rollercoaster for the past 2 years. I've got most of my experience in Java, but also some in C/C++ & Python. I also have moderate experience in JavaScript, HTML & CSS, which when paired together, form the websites I create, then deploy with GitHub Pages.
    I'm looking to be more into the field of cybersecurity, but also more software development, as my major is fundamentally a specialization of computer science. I am open to all kinds of roles, across the fields of cybersecurity, software development/engineering, web development, and more.
    The buzzword is AI (Artificial Intelligence), and I'm trying to learn more, use it more but sensibly. I will right away confess that AI has generated certain components (the menu bar, as well as the icons in the Contact Me page, and the typing effect visible to you up at the top) of this page, but the rest has been me, though AI predicts what to write, and that is fine if it knows my style. 
    I still will NOT be ever using it in academic work, or even professional where prohibitied. 
    </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Work</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0);">Indian </span><span style="color: white;">Society </span><span style="color: green;">of Calgary, </span>Graphics and Social Media Summer Intern | May - August 2025</h5>
    <p>
    In this role over the summer, I created and collaborated on a variety of designs. I leveraged my experience & skills in graphic designing, particularly with Canva.
    I created different types of graphics, dependent on the requirements. It varied from product advertisements, to festive designs, and inforgraphics. This brought me exposure to different types & formats of graphics, and I learned some tips & tricks along the way.
    I also relearned some previous habits & tricks which I had forgotten. This job will always remain special to me, as it is my first job!
    </p>
    <h4>Clubs, Leadership & Volunteering</h4>
    <h5><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 121);">ReWire </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 59, 169);">Club,</span> Operations Associate | July 2025 - present</h5>
    <p>
    As Operations Associate of the productivity-focused ReWire Club, I would be overlooking the regular functioning of the club's many aspects. 
    This includes organization of many club assets, such as our files & communications, and handling a part of logistics for our events. 
    </p>
    <h3>Interests, Hobbies, Entertainment</h3>
    <p>
    My interests are in mainstream consumer technology, (particularly smartphones). I've followed Apple the most, but try to keep up with others. Cricket remains my sport of choice where I am a supporter of the <span style="color: blue;">Indian national team,</span> <span style="color: rgb(196, 0, 0);">Royal Challengers Bengaluru [WPL, IPL]</span>, with a deep following since the pandemic began. I casually play badminton as well.
    My entertainment is across areas. In English, it mostly is podcasts, though I've seen some TV shows & films as well. Movies are mostly in Hindi for me, as is the case for music. Sprinkle in some Punjabi songs & films too. Other interests of mine include graphic designing, photography, and reading. I'll not list out all my favourites across categories, as the list would be really long. I will consider putting a typing effect for it, if I can figure it out at a later time.
