This is going to be my personal page, consisting of my projects, and me.

## My Preferences
I am into coding, and graphic design. I'm at 1500 designs in Canva. Possibly ridiculous? Yes, but it is something I thoroughly enjoy. As for coding, I have some projects related to my interests (cricket in particular), in Java. And, I am slowly going to build it here on GitHub.
