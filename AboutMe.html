    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Rishi. I am a student at York University, nearing the end of my second year. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Security. The experience so far has been a rollercoaster of sorts, with some ups and downs, but well that was to be expected.
    I have always been fascinated in technology, particularly mainstream consumer electronics, like smartphones, tablets, computers, and headphones. Admitted I'm a little behind with a huge 50+ watch later list in YouTube, but I'll catch up over time. I've also been playing around with artificial intelligence models, mostly for fun.
    I personally maintain to minimize the use of AI in anything I share to someone, partly for integrity reasons, and partly to claim I've done the work. I am opening up to it though, using it to enhance my cover letter, but even then it is not directly copy pasted, because that is not sensible. Another case would be here, making my page, as it writes in the basic head details which very much would be a repetition, so it makes life easier (even now as I am typing here).
    <br>
    AI ethics aside, let's talk fun stuff. The sport I follow is cricket. Have been following it for very deeply since the pandemic, though I've sporadically followed it since 2016. The teams I support are India's national team, as well as the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL as well as WPL. AI has guessed correct, my favourite player is Virat Kohli, he is why I first started viewing the game. The other person, who's played a huge role in my love for the longest format, the red-ball game (test-match cricket), is the one and only, Rishabh Pant, easily the player I probably adore the most after Virat. 
    Other players I really like are Jasprit Bumrah (arguably amongst the best bowlers right now!), Smriti Mandhana, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Harleen Deol, Sanju Samson from India. Other international players I like are Kane Williamson, Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes, Joe Root, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc.

    I also listen to many podcasts, mostly related to tech, and cricket, sprinkled with some other ones as well. My 2 favourite podcasts have to be "The Edges & Sledges Cricket Podcast" and "The Vergecast", co-hosts of both the shows share their thoughts well, and in the process, I laugh out loud a lot! I also thoroughly enjoy "Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast", for similar reasons. I feel test matches are not covered any better than by BBC's Test Match Special.
    I mostly listen to Hindi songs, with a bit of Punjabi as well. I am trying to listen to more English songs, but not there yet. It is similar with respect to films and TV shows.
    That being said, some of my favourites in the English language have to be "Stranger Things", "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", the "Mission: Impossible" series, "The Office", and I recently had a blast watching "A Minecraft Movie". I've lost track of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but "Avengers: Endgame", and the "Spider-Man" installments have to be amongst those I've thoroughly enjoyed.
