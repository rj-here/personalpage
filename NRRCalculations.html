    <h2>NRR Calculations</h2>
    <p>Here, you will see how to calculate the NRR or Net Run Rate, in cricket.
        <br>
    It is calculated by the difference of average run rate in games <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/page/429305.html">(via ESPNCricinfo):</a>
    So, the calculations take place as follows:
    </p>
    <h5>Team 1 (FOR):</h5>
    <p>
        Take the total number of runs scored, by the team across all their games played, and divide it by the number of overs faced.
        So, if a run of 3 ODI games for this team goes: 290 runs in 50 overs, 267 runs in 47.2 overs (so, 47 full overs with 2 more deliveries of the next over), 335 runs in 50 overs, then:
        You will add the runs so 290 + 267 + 335 = 892 runs AND the overs faced will be 50 + (47*6 + 2)/6 + 50 = 147.33 overs.
        So, the net run rate for this team will be 892/147.33 = 6.05. 
    </p>
    <h5>Team 2 (AGAINST):</h5>
    <p>
        It will be very similar to the FOR team, but there will be a modification. In the case of the AGAINST team, it will always be the maximum overs taken irrespective of whether the team was bowled out early in a game.
        So, if the 3 opposition teams that played these ODI games had these scores: 287 in 50 overs, 270 in 45 overs, 105 in 21.4 overs (so, 21 full overs with 4 more deliveries of the next over), then:
        You will add the runs so 287 + 270 + 105 = 662 runs AND the overs faced will NOT be 50 + (45*6)/6 + (21*6 + 4)/6 = 116.67 overs, and instead be 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 overs.
        So, the net run rate for this team will be 662/150 = 4.41.
    </p>
    <h5>Final NRR:</h5>  
    <p>
        And then, the NRR will be calculated as follows (For - Against): NRR: 6.05 - 4.41 = 1.64
        <br>
        So, that is my example. Want to do it yourself, well here it is: </p>
    <div id="box">
        <p id = "mydata"></p>
        <button onclick="getNRR()">Calculate your net run rate!</button>
        <strong> <p id="nrr"> </p></strong>
    </div>
