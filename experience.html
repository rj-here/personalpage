    <h5>Graphics & Social Media Intern | May to August 2025</h5>
    <p>
    In this role, I was responsible for creating graphics according to the needs. This had a few varieties, in the form of infographics based on articles, product advertisements, and festive designs with the festive Indian calendar having many occasions lined up, such as Diwali.
    I further enhanced my graphic designing skills in Canva, and learned some new tricks along the way, which I have or will go on to implement in my personal designs.

    <h4>Lassonde School of Engineering at <span style="color: rgb(255, 45, 45);">York University</span></h4>
    <h5>Program Representative for Fall Campus Day | October 2025</h5>
    <p>
    In this one-off opportunity, I represented the Computer Security program for Fall Campus Day.
    I spoke to perspective students and families about what the program has to offer, how it differs to Computer Science as well as the Engineering programs.
    I also addressed questions and concerns regarding many things, in addition to sharing anecdotes from my personal experience as a (commuting) student.
    It was very useful from a networking point of view as well, meeting many new people.
    I enjoyed myself loads, with a hope to return for the 2026 edition as well.

    <h3>Hackathons</h3>
    <h4>MLH</h4>
    <h5>Global Hack Week</h5>
    <h6>Beginners Week | August 2025</h6>
    <p>
    At the time, I in a (rather silly) train of thought said no to a hackathon, I started hunting hackathons.
    During this, I stumbled into MLH's Global Hack Week, a monthly week-long virtual event. This version was focused on beginners.
    This was over a span of a few days, during which I learned basics in Figma, GitHub, and more. There isn't a project to show.
    </p>
    <h6>Open Source Week | October 2025</h6>
    <p>
    With Reading Week providing a relaxation period, I signed up for some events in the open source focused Global Hack Week,
    It was a nice experience, where I learned about Agent Mode in GitHub Copilot, and how it can be better utilized. Unfortunately, my particpation was to one workshop owing to Diwali preparations.
    </p>
    <h6>API Week | November 2025    </h6>
    <p>
    After a grilling week personally & profesionally, I signed up for a MongoDB 101 workshop on a rare relaxation day I had.
    It was a good experience, and I hope to utilize MongoDB going ahead.
    </p>
    <h4>Canada DevOps Community of Practice</h4>
    <h5>DevOps GenAI Hackathon Missisauga | November 2025</h5>
    <p>
    This was my first ever hackathon experience, and it was an insightful one. I was paired with 3 senior & experienced tech professionals, who guided me along the process.
    We were tasked to create a DevOps solution with the use of generative AI tools. The creation by us was <a href="https://github.com/suraj9581/Code-Rush">Code Rush</a>, a tool that would analyze a GitHub repository, and provide the main details such as owner, contributors, tech stack, purpose, and more.
    My responsibilty was to create the API. It was mostly agentic.
    We didn't win anything, but the experience far exceeded the need of a prize.
