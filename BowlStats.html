    <h2>Bowling Statistics</h2>
    <p>Here, we're going to calculate some basic statistics regarding bowling.</p>
    <h3>Bowling Average</h3>
    <p>The bowling average is calculated as the amount of runs scored off the bowler per wicket <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_average">(via Wikipedia)</a>, so let's go ahead and do so.</p>
    <h3>Bowling Strike Rate</h3>
    <p>The bowling stirke rate is calculated as the number of deliveries taken to get a wicket <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate">(via Wikipedia)</a>, and the less the better! (chances are then the bowler is on ðŸ”¥)</p>
    <h3>Economy Rates</h3>
    <p>The economy is the average runs scored in a given over off a bowler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate"></a>(via Wikipedia), so if a bowler gives 24 runs across their 4 overs in a T20 spell, their economy is 6.00. The lower the better. However, one bad over can mess things up. Let's say a bowler in 3 overs has given 15 runs, their economy is 5.00, but if their 4th over goes for a whopping 20 runs, that means their 4 overs has given 35 runs, meaning an economy of 8.75.</p>
