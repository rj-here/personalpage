    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is a Rishi. I am a student at York University, nearing the end of my second year. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Security. The experience so far has been a rollercoaster of sorts, with some ups and downs, but well that was to be expected.
    My experience with coding has been highly dominated by Java. Most of my projects have been in it, and I feel I've got a moderate command on it. Good or great would sound nice to say, but life humbles me, and I am reminded of much more progress is to be made, gradually over time. As mentioned in James Clear's Atomic Habits, just being 1% better daily is over 37 times better a year. Add to it, I've also been working on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, in conjunction with GitHub, and building out my personal page here.
    I have always been fascinated in technology, particularly mainstream consumer electronics, like smartphones, tablets, computers, and headphones. Admitted I'm a little behind with a huge 50+ watch later list in YouTube, but I'll catch up over time. I've also been playing around with artificial intelligence models, mostly for fun.
    I personally maintain to minimize the use of AI in anything I share to someone, partly for integrity reasons, and partly to claim I've done the work. I am opening up to it though, using it to enhance my cover letter, but even then it is not directly copy pasted, because that is not sensible. GitHub Copilot is a bit too helpful...it suggests code & words which is very close if not exactly what I intended to type up, and it's impressive to see the progess of artificial intelligence, but this is what the threat is as well. Thankfully, I still know what it is doing, so I can explain the code and process upon being asked. 
    <br>
    AI ethics aside, let's talk fun stuff. The sport I follow is cricket. Have been following it for very deeply since the pandemic, though I've sporadically followed it since 2016. The teams I support are India's national team, as well as the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL as well as WPL. AI has guessed correct, my favourite player is Virat Kohli, he is why I first started viewing the game. The other person, who's played a huge role in my love for the longest format, the red-ball game (test-match cricket), is the one and only, Rishabh Pant, easily the player I probably adore the most after Virat. 
    Other players I really like are Jasprit Bumrah (arguably amongst the best bowlers right now!), Smriti Mandhana, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Harleen Deol, Sanju Samson from India. Other international players I like are Kane Williamson, Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes, Joe Root, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc.
    I'm not a great player at the sport yet myself, but casual fun is always casual fun. Badminton is another sport I casually play, and sporadically, and my performance in it is much better than in cricket.
    <br>
    I also listen to many podcasts, mostly related to tech, and cricket, sprinkled with some other ones as well. My 2 favourite podcasts have to be "The Edges & Sledges Cricket Podcast" and "The Vergecast", co-hosts of both the shows share their thoughts well, and in the process, I laugh out loud a lot! I also thoroughly enjoy "Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast", for similar reasons. I feel test matches are not covered any better than by BBC's Test Match Special. Included within it is "No Balls", which is co-hosted by Kate Cross & Alex Hartley, from England, something I enjoy for casual laughs and realize that cricketers also have a normal life.
    I mostly listen to Hindi songs, with a bit of Punjabi as well. I am trying to listen to more English songs, but not there yet. It is similar with respect to films and TV shows.
    That being said, some of my favourites in the English language have to be "Stranger Things" (I recently saw the date announcement, and I'm pumped for season 5), "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", the "Mission: Impossible" series, "The Office", and I recently had a blast watching "A Minecraft Movie". I've lost track of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but "Avengers: Endgame", and the "Spider-Man" installments have to be amongst those I've thoroughly enjoyed.
