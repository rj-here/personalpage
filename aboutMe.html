    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Academics & Experience</h3>
    <p>I am a student at York University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Security. The 2 years have been a rollercoaster, with ups, downs, laughs, learnings, memories, and much more. My experience in coding languages remains dominant with Java, and I am slowly building up experiences in that.
    I feel I have a moderate command on the language, though the scope for improvement always exists. I also am trying to improve my knowledge & skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, in conjunction with GitHub. I am building out projects slowly, with the completed ones available in the Projects section. I look to work more in C, and once I have learned the basics, Python (currently in progress). 
    AI has made life easy & difficult simultaneously. I try to minimize it in what I am sharing to others (including this site), but have realized that it will play a role in my life, particularly in this profession. Thankfully, I understand what is being done, meaning I can explain to someone else as well what the code is doing. It's a funny problem that AI knows exactly what I want to write more often than not. That being said, I still refrain from directly copy pasting what AI is providing as much as I can.

    <h3>Entertainment, Hobbies & Interests</h3>
    <p>Enough on AI ethics, I will talk entertainment, hobbies & interests. I enjoy watching cricket, though I am not as good a player of the sport, which I have sporadically viewed since 2016, and have been following deeply since late 2020. 
    Teams I support are the <span style="color: blue;">Indian national team,</span> in addition to the <span style="color: rgb(255, 40, 40);">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</span> in the IPL & WPL. 
    My favourite player is Virat Kohli (AI guessed correct!), he is the reason I initially began following the game. The reason I started following the game more deeply, specifically the red-ball format (Test cricket), is a player called Rishabh Pant. 
    There are many other players I like and admire, but the list can get a little long. Badminton is the other sport I play. It is casual, and I think I perform better in that than cricket. 
    I listen to many podcasts, of which I'll share some of my favourites. “The Edges & Sledges Cricket Podcast”, and “The Vergecast” have co-hosts communicate thoughts effectively, and also giving many laughs along the way. 
    “Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast”, is also enjoyable for similar reasons. Test matches, are not covered better in my opinion than by BBC's “Test Match Special”, which also includes “No Balls” co-hosted by England women players, Alex Hartley & Kate Cross. 
    I still have lots of English content to consume, but some of my favourite content in the language includes “Stranger Things”, “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”, “The Mentalist”, in addition to more. I mostly listen to Hindi music, sprinkled with some Punjabi songs too.
    Graphic designing is a fun hobby to have, as well as photography. Reading is also something I enjoy, mixing self-help with entertainment as I still remain a loyal reader of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, created by Jeff Kinney. 
    Technology is also a great interest I have, tracking what's going on mostly in Apple world, but generally, following mainstream consumer electronics, software, and as it has now become a seperate topic of discussion, artificial intelligence.
