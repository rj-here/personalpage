    <h2>Batting Statistics</h2>
    <p>Here, we're going to calculate some basic statistics, with regards to batters, and batting.</p>
    <h3>Strike Rate: </h3>
    <p>Strike rate is the scoring rate of an individual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate">(via Wikipedia)</a>, and it is pretty simple. Take the runs scored by a batter, and divide it by the number of balls they have faced, then multiply it by 100.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here's an example from the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-1298134/england-vs-india-2nd-semi-final-1298178/full-scorecard">2022 T20 World Cup semi-final played between England & India,</a> Virat Kohli scored 50 runs in 40 balls. So, 50 runs divided by 40 balls, is 1.25, then multiply it by 100, that means he finished with a strike rate of 125.00.

        <button onclick="getStrikeRate()">Calculate your strike rate!</button>
        <strong> <p id="strikeRate"> </p></strong>

    <h3>Batting Average: </h3>
    <p>The batting average is how much a batter scores in one outing in terms of runs on average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket)">(via Wikipedia)</a>, and it gives an indication of the skill. Though as suggested by Wikipedia, and myself...do not make the sole metric!</p>

        <p id="mydataforAvg"></p>
        <button onclick="getAverage()">Calculate your batting average!</button>
        <strong> <p id="average"> </p></strong>
