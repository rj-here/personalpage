        <h3>Trip Planner</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Python</p>
        <p>A simple trip planner, based on my personal Notion template for planning trips. It asks simple questions such as the trip's length, budget, and the people accompanying. It formulated the start of my Python pyramid.</p>

        <h3>Weekend Planner</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Python</p>
        <p>A simple weekend planner, was another idea that struck my mind. It asks simple questions such as the regular tasks, occasional tasks, and special things like a dinner out.</p>

        <h3>Temperature Convertor</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Python</p>
        <p>A simple temperature convertor, which converts between Celsius & Fahrenheit. The inspiration behind it was me randomly watching a YouTube video, and surprised to hear 100 degrees, for it to then register that the creator is American, and they speak in Fahrenheit.</p>

        <h3>Calculator</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> C</p>
        <p>A simple calculator, which performs basic arithmetic operations. It was my first C program, and I built it to reiterate the fundamentals of C programming.</p>

        <h3>Some Economic Fun</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript</p>
        <p>I was keen to further enhance my understanding of prevoiusly learned web development fundamentals in the form of JavaScript, CSS & HTML. I wanted to explore a slightly different approach and aesthetic, as well as try and apply my learnings from my classes introducing microeconomics and macroeconomics.
        The books for them are MicroEconomics for Life: Third Edition & MacroEconomics for Life: Third Edition, both by Avi J. Cohen & Scott A. Walla.

        <h3>Should You or Should You Not?</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript</p>
        <p>A simple tool to help you make decisions, based on the points you have for and against making it. It is partly inspired from the concept of utilitarianism, which I learned in my ethics (philospohy) classes, PHIL 2070 & 2075.
        The books for them are Everyday Ethics by Brian Huss, and Applied Ethics: An Impartial Introduction by Elizabeth Jackson, Tyron Goldscmidt, Dustin Crummett, and Rebecca Chan.

        <div class="project-card" data-language="java" data-year="2024" data-category="game" data-people="solo" data-hackathon="none" data-title="Snakes & Ladders">
        <h3>Snakes & Ladders</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Java</p>
        <p>My first real "project". I made a simple Snakes & Ladders implementation, using Java. It is based off a personal board I have, and coded in a manner that considers the playing style I've grown up with.</p>

        <h3>LBW - Little Bit Wiser in Cricket</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript</p>
        <p>A simple website involving some basic calculations related to cricket, for bowlers & batters. And, you can also get net run rate, a metric useful in tournament performance evaluation.</p>

        <div class="project-card" data-language="java" data-year="2024" data-category="cricket" data-people="solo" data-hackathon="none" data-title="T20 World Cup Quiz">
        <h3>T20 World Cup Quiz</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Java</p>
        <p>Another of my first few projects, this was a simple quiz game regarding some simple details of the T20 World Cup (previously known as World T20). It covers all editions from the inaugral to the most recent (2024) editions, with an update soon for the 2026 editions as they take place.</p>

        <div class="project-card" data-language="java" data-year="2025" data-category="cricket" data-people="solo" data-hackathon="none" data-title="Net Run Rate Calculator">
        <h3>Net Run Rate Calculator</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Java</p>
        <p>A simple tool to calculate net run rate in cricket, based on the runs scored and overs faced by a team. I had first cracked it here, and then implemented it in LBW.</p>

        <div class="project-card" data-language="java" data-year="2025" data-category="cricket" data-people="solo" data-hackathon="none" data-title="DLS Calculator">
        <h3>DLS Calculator</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Java</p>
        <p>This takes you to the Java file, where I (finally!) created a tool to determine the scores for the chasing team in rain-affected matches of cricket. This was mostly done before hand with fixes and touches done in the directory. This was a tougher project to do just due to the sheer involvement of numbers for this one, but I come out of completing this with immense satisfaction. Credit where due to GitHub Copilot!
        One case is hidden due to computational errors which I cannot seem to figure out the issue of.

        <div class="project-card" data-language="java" data-year="2025" data-category="cricket" data-people="solo" data-hackathon="none" data-title="ICC Tournament Points Database">
        <h3>ICC Tournament Points Database</h3>
        <p><strong>Language:</strong> Java</p>
        <p>This links to the Java file, considering all the big points (winners, runners-up, player of the tournament, player of the final) for all (senior) ICC tournaments conducted so far, so the ICC Women's & Men's Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup (2026 editions under a year away), Champions Trophy (first women's T20 edition from 2027), and the World Test Championship for the men (2025-27 cycle ongoing).
        A fun, yet demanding project, but I am glad to have it done. Lots of Wikipedia pages & ESPNCricinfo scorecards were referenced to get details correct (which I've tried to go over multiple times), and quite a bit of patience was the ask of the task.
        Again, credit where due to GitHub Copilot. Up next, the T20 World Cups of 2026!
