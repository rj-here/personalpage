    <p>Here, you will find all my (completed) projects, either independently or in collaboration with others.</p>
    <h3>Independently</h3>
    <h6>Cricket</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://rj-here.github.io/lbwincricket/">LBW - Little Bit Wiser in Cricket</a>
        <br>
        It is a simple site containing some basic calculations for you to do in the sport of cricket.
        <br>
        Click the buttons below to directly access the calculation(s) you want.
    </p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwNRR()">Net Run Rate</button></p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwBatStats()">Batting Statistics</button></p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwBowlStats()">Bowling Statistics</button></p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/T20WCQuiz.java">T20 World Cup Quiz: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, in which I created a simple quiz game, based on the ICC Women's and Men's T20 World Cups. The questions are about the host venues, winners, player of the tournament, player of the final.
        <br>
        I've hard coded the details in different methods, to keep a bit of clarity, and not make my code super messy. I already had the file, just added comments and brought it into <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle">the GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/NRR.java">NRR: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, which is where I first cracked how to calculate net run rate. Like the project above, and subsequent ones, I had the file from before and just brought it into the directory.
    </p>


    <h6>University Learnings</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://rj-here.github.io/someeconomicfun/">Some Economic Fun</a>
        <br>
        This simple site contains a few mini programs containing an application of some concepts I learned in introduction to microeconomics (ECON 1000), and macroeconomics (ECON 1010), at York University.
        <br>
        The books for them are MicroEconomics for Life: Third Edition & MacroEconomics for Life: Third Edition, both by Avi J. Cohen & Scott A. Walla
        <br>
        Click below to directly access them.

    <p><button onclick="econFunDS()">Demand & Supply</button></p>
    <p><button onclick="econFunER()">Exchange Rates</button></p>

    <h6>Games</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/SnakesAndLadders.java">Snakes & Ladders: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, in which I recreated my personal Snakes & Ladders board, with some hard coding dependent on the position of the player, and a bit of tweaks to how I have played, where 3 rolls of 6 is unlucky. Like the T20 World Cup Quiz, this was also already made, and brought into the repository, which is how I'll bring my still in-progress projects.


    </p>

    <h6>Utilities</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/cforyourself/blob/main/calculator.c">Calculator: C</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the C file, in which I made a simple calculator tool. Unlike Java, I made this and kept going <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/cforyourself">in the directory</a>, like with the sites I've shown so far. This idea was part of an AI-generated list.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/pythonpyramid/blob/main/TripPlanner.py">Trip Planner: Python</a>
        <br>
        This will link you to the Python file, in which I made a basic trip planner. It's unconventional as it takes more of a spin from a personal Notion template, but I added budget in this as well. It asks some simple questions regarding length of trip, the budget of yours, the people accompanying, and also the location. This is part of <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/pythonpyramid/">my Python repository</a>, in which I am grwoing out a collection of Python programs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/pythonpyramid/blob/main/WeekendPlanner.py">Weekend Planner: Python</a>
        <br>
        This takes you to the Python file, in which I created a simple weekend planner. Answer some questions about weekend plans, including regular, and occasional tasks, in addition to special things like eating out for dinner. This also is part of the Python pyramid that I'm building.
