    <p>Here, you will find all my (completed) projects, either independently or in collaboration with others.</p>
    <h3>Independently</h3>
    <h6>Cricket</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://rj-here.github.io/lbwincricket/">LBW - Little Bit Wiser in Cricket</a>
        <br>
        It is a simple site containing some basic calculations for you to do in the sport of cricket.
        <br>
        Click the buttons below to directly access the calculation(s) you want.
    </p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwNRR()">Net Run Rate</button></p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwBatStats()">Batting Statistics</button></p>
    <p><button onclick="lbwBowlStats()">Bowling Statistics</button></p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/T20WCQuiz.java">T20 World Cup Quiz: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, in which I created a simple quiz game, based on the ICC Women's and Men's T20 World Cups. The questions are about the host venues, winners, player of the tournament, player of the final.
        <br>
        I've hard coded the details in different methods, to keep a bit of clarity, and not make my code super messy. I already had the file, just added comments and brought it into <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle">the GitHub repository</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/NRR.java">NRR: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, which is where I first cracked how to calculate net run rate. Like the project above, and subsequent ones, I had the file from before and just brought it into the directory.
    </p>


    <h6>University Learnings</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://rj-here.github.io/someeconomicfun/">Some Economic Fun</a>
        <br>
        This simple site contains a few mini programs containing an application of some concepts I learned in introduction to microeconomics (ECON 1000), and macroeconomics (ECON 1010), at York University.
        <br>
        The books for them are MicroEconomics for Life: Third Edition & MacroEconomics for Life: Third Edition, both by Avi J. Cohen & Scott A. Walla
        <br>

    <p><button onclick="econFunER()">Exchange Rates</button></p>

    <h6>Games</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/javajungle/blob/main/rCodes/src/projects2025/SnakesAndLadders.java">Snakes & Ladders: Java</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the Java file, in which I recreated my personal Snakes & Ladders board, with some hard coding dependent on the position of the player, and a bit of tweaks to how I have played, where 3 rolls of 6 is unlucky. Like the T20 World Cup Quiz, this was also already made, and brought into the repository, which is how I'll bring my still in-progress projects.


    </p>

    <h6>Utilities</h6>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/cforyourself/blob/main/calculator.c">Calculator: C</a>
        <br>
        This links you to the C file, in which I made a simple calculator tool. Unlike Java, I made this and kept going <a href="https://github.com/rj-here/cforyourself">in the directory</a>, like with the sites I've shown so far. This idea was part of an AI-generated list.
