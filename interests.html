    <h2>Interests, Hobbies & Entertainment</h2>
    <p>
    My interests are in mainstream consumer technology (particularly smartphones). I try to keep up with what's going on in that space.
    As I now make my way into software & web development, more things have begun to click to me, and yeah AI is right, pique my interest too.
    The main company I follow is Apple, but try to keep up with the others too.
    I am a casual badminton player, where I consider myself decent. Another sport would be cricket, which I watch WAY MORE than play.
    The teams I support are (obviously) the <span style="color: rgb(0, 114, 175);">Indian National Cricket Team</span>, and the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Royal Challengers Bengaluru</span> in both the WPL & IPL.
    I do enjoy myself some <span style="color: yellow;">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</span>, <span style="color: rgb(208, 0, 0);">Stranger Things</span>, and <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Friends</span>.
    Most of my content consumption remains in Hindi, be it movies, shows, or music. But some Punjabi is there too.
    I listen to quite a few podcasts as well, some of my favourites being <span style="color: rgb(74, 0, 193);">The Vergecast</span>, BBC's <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 187);">Test Match Special</span> (also including No Balls hosted by Kate Cross & Alex Hartley), <span style="color: rgb(0, 114, 175);">The Edges & Sledges Cricket Podcast</span>, <span style="color: red;">Waveform: The MKBHD Podcast</span>.
    I find it insightful to hear about cricket, in which I personally prefer Tests, and I just end up laughing every weekend hearing a huge chunk of the Friday episodes of The Vergecast, it is purely the co-hosts.
    I also find myself indulge in graphic designing on Canva, photography, both of which have played its role in my aesthetic taste in all aspects. I do read books ocassionally, mixing self-help and a bit of fiction as well. I'm a Wimpy Kid buff!
